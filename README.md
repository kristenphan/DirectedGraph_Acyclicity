<br/>
Problem Introduction:
<br/>
A Computer Science curriculum specifies the prerequisites for each course as a list of courses that should be
taken before taking this course. You would like to perform a consistency check of the curriculum, that is,
to check that there are no cyclic dependencies. For this, you construct the following directed graph: vertices
correspond to courses, there is a directed edge (𝑢, 𝑣) is the course 𝑢 should be taken before the course 𝑣.
Then, it is enough to check whether the resulting graph contains a cycle.
<br/>
<br/>
Task: Check whether a given directed graph with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges contains a cycle.
<br/>
<br/>
Input Format: A graph is given in the standard format.
<br/>
<br/>
Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 103, 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 103.
<br/>
<br/>
Output Format: Output 1 if the graph contains a cycle and 0 otherwise.

__Disclaimer__: 
<br/>
If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and won’t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)"
